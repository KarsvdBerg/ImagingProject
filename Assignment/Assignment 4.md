# Assignment 4
## Exercise 1
Transfer learning is a method in machine learning. Transfer learning is different than other, more traditional machine learning. Transfer learning makes use of already excisting source tasks in a related target task [1]. Trnsfer learning makes sense when using it from task 1 to task B when both tasks have the same input, there is a lot more data for task A than for task B, and whenfeatures from task A can be helpful for B.
It makes sense to apply transfer learning from ImageNet to the Patch-CAMELYON dataset, as the datasets have the same input, eg. images. Both datasets can be used in image recognition, so the implementation of both datasets is, in a way, the same.
