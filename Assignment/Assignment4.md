# Assignment 4
## Exercise 1
Transfer learning is a method in machine learning. Transfer learning is different than other, more traditional machine learning. Transfer learning makes use of already excisting source tasks in a related target task [1]. Transfer learning makes sense when:
  1. Task A and B have the same input
  2. Task A has a lot more data than task B
  3. Low level features from A can be helpful for B

It makes sense to apply transfer learning from ImageNet to the Patch-CAMELYON dataset, as the datasets have the same input, eg. images. Both datasets can be used in image recognition, so the implementation of both datasets is, in a way, the same.
