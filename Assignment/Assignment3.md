## Exercise 1
The ROC curve is the 'Receiver Operating Characteristic' curve and is used to evaluate the quality of the classifier output.
The curve has the false positive rates on the x-axis and the true positives on the y-axis. 
A larger area under the curve is usually better. [1] 
## Exercise 2
Convolution layers can detect paterns in images, with deeper layers being able to "detect" more complicated shapes than the first few layers
