-Overfitting happens if the number of hidden neurons is too big.
-Sigmoidal acitvation zorgt voor faster learning
-they use fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient
- the learning rate plays major role in NN performances, choosing a wrong value can conclude in unstability of the algorithm

- Since the image of melanoma cancer has no distinct feature, therefore, deep layer CNN cannot perform well for melanoma cancer detection due to overfitting problem. 
This problem arises when the model is trained too well. Consequently, it starts to have deleterious effect on the results. 
It is suggested that CNN architecture is more suitable for identifying texture-based images and it can avoid overfitting problems.
