Our task: develop a deep neural network model that can identify metastases in image patches from histological preparations of lymph node tissue from breast cancer patients.

Neural networks:
- Are a class of models within machine learning
- Are a specific set of algorithms
- 'Deep' in 'deep neural network' stand for the amount of layers
- learn from obsercational data, figure out their own solution to the problem. 

4 kinds of network architectures:
- unsupervised pre-trained networks
- convolutional neural networks
- recurrent neural networks --> used for example for speech recognition
- recursive neural networks --> hierarchical network

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is mostly used for image recognition, so I think we need to use that network.
It has convolutions inside, which can see the edges of an object. In our case, we could train the network to recognize the edges of metasases.

There are multiple methods which we can use for a CNN.
