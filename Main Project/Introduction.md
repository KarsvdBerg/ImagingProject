## Introduction
 
The presence of metastases is an important component of breast cancer staging [1]. Pathologist evaluate this by examination of histological preparations of lymph nodes. Currently, the lymph nodes are assessed manually. This is a rather complicated method that can result in a missed metastases. Consequently, this will result in an inadequate treatment for the patient. Introducing whole-slide image analysis using deep learning will optimize the assessment of metastases [2]. It will also make the detection of metastases more accurate and objective.
