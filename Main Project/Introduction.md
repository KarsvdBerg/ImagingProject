## Introduction
 
Breast cancer is  a cancer form that is present in the cell of the breasts. It occurs when breast cells begin to grow abnormally. The biggest risk factor of getting breast cancer is being female. Breast cancer is there for the most common cancer among women, with a world prevalence of 2.1 million women each year. Approximately 15% of all cancer deaths among women are caused by breast cancer [1]. In order to improve breast cancer survival, early detection of metastases in the breast is crucial [2]. 
Currently, the detection of metastases is done pathologists on histological preparations of the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are assessed manually, it is a rather labor intensive and error-prone process [3]. This can consequently result in an inadequate treatment for the patient. Introducing whole-slide image analysis using deep learning will optimize the assessment of metastases [4]. The detection of the metastases by deep learning will increase the speed and accuracy of the detection. In addition to this will it also save the pathologists a lot of time, they will have a more evaluating role instead of a determining role in the detection of metastases. It will also make the detection of metastases more accurate and objective.
