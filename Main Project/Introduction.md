## Introduction
 
The presence of metastases is an important component of breast cancer staging [1]. Pathologist evaluate this by examination of histological preparations of lymph nodes. Currently, the lymph nodes are assessed manually. It is a labor intensive and error-prone process [2]. Consequently, this will result in an inadequate treatment for the patient. Introducing whole-slide image analysis using deep learning will optimize the assessment of metastases [3]. By introducing whole-slide imaging, the workflow in a pathology lab will change. The detection of the metastases by deep learning will increase the speed and accuracy of the detection. It will save the pathologists a lot of time, they will now have a more evaluating role, instead of a determining role in the detection of metastases.It will also make the detection of metastases more accurate and objective.
